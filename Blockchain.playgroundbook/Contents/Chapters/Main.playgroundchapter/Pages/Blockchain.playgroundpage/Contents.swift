/*:
 Those transactions are now pending. They are not valid until they are part of a new Block. To create a new Block the Block needs to be *mined*.
 Mining means we are looking for a matching Proof of Work for the previous hash. When we found it we can create a new Block with those values.
 
 Lets create a mining function for the `Blockchain` class:
 1. Get the current last Block of the Blockchain with `self.currentChain.last!`
 2. Get the `previousHash` of the last Block with `lastBlock.hash()`
 3. Search for a Proof of Work to the `previousHash`. The Blockchain has a function for this called `self.searchForProofOfWork(previousHash:)`. *This is where the major work of the mining is done*
 4. Now get index of the last Block and add 1 to it for the new index
 5. Create the new Block and add it to the `self.currentChain`

 If you want to you can mine more blocks. Just repeat the previous steps (add Transactions and then mine)

 # Conclusion
 We saw how to create a basic Block, what the Proof of Work is and how the Blocks are chained together. With this technique we can make a manipulation safe transaction list. If an attacker wants to manipulate the values of one block in the chain he needs to manipulate all blocks before and after this block which will be a *hard* task depending on the Proof of Work.
